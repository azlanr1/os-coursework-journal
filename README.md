# Operating Systems Coursework

This repository contains my coursework submission for the CMPN202 Operating Systems module.

The coursework documents the planning, configuration, security hardening, performance testing, and security auditing of an Ubuntu Server virtual machine. All work was carried out using a Windows workstation and a Linux server managed remotely via SSH.

## Repository Structure

- week1.md – System planning and distribution selection  
- week2.md – Security planning and threat modelling  
- week3.md – Application selection for performance testing  
- week4.md – Initial system configuration and security implementation  
- week5.md – Advanced security and monitoring infrastructure  
- week6.md – Performance evaluation and analysis  
- week7.md – Security audit and system evaluation  

Supporting scripts and screenshots are included within the relevant weekly sections.

## Video Demonstration

A video demonstration accompanies this submission and shows:
- Both systems running
