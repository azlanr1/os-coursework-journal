Operating Systems Coursework Journal:

This GitHub Pages site is where I’m documenting all of my work for the Operating
Systems coursework. The project runs over seven weeks, and each week focuses on a different
part of setting up, configuring, securing, and analysing a Linux server.

The journal is organised so that each week has its own page, making it easier to follow my
progress step by step. Throughout the project I’ll be working with a headless Ubuntu Server
VM in VirtualBox, managing it from my workstation, and gradually building up everything from
basic setup to security hardening and performance testing.


Contents:

- [Week 1 – System Planning & Setup](week1.md)  
- [Week 2 – Security Planning & Threat Modelling](week2.md)  
- [Week 3 – Application Selection for Testing](week3.md)  
- [Week 4 – Initial Security Configuration](week4.md)  
- [Week 5 – Advanced Security & Monitoring](week5.md)  
- [Week 6 – Performance Testing & Analysis](week6.md)  
- [Week 7 – Final Security Audit & Evaluation](week7.md)


As I go through the coursework, I’ll be adding screenshots, command outputs, reflections,
and explanations for each stage. This journal is a record of everything I learned, the choices
I made, and how the system developed week by week.
